Blood Sugar Detection System 

Overview:
This project combines two key components: blood sugar detection utilizing logistic regression and a web application developed with Django. The aim is to predict blood sugar levels based on various physiological parameters using logistic regression, and to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing and visualizing these predictions through a web application built with Django.

Blood sugar detection:
The blood sugar detection module utilizes logistic regression, a statistical method commonly employed for binary classification tasks. By training the model on a dataset containing features such as glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, etc., the logistic regression algorithm predicts whether an individual is likely to have normal or abnormal blood sugar levels. This predictive capability can assist healthcare professionals and individuals in managing diabetes and related conditions.

Webpage Design with Django:
The web application built using Django serves as an interface for interacting with the blood sugar detection model. Users can input their physiological parameters via a form, and the application provides predictions for their blood sugar levels based on the logistic regression model. Additionally, the web interface offers features such as data visualization, user authentication, and possibly integration with external APIs for enhanced functionality.

Usage:
To utilize the blood sugar detection module and access the web application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the necessary dependencies as outlined in the project's requirements.
3. Train the logistic regression model using the provided dataset or your own data if applicable.
4. Start the Django server and navigate to the web application.
5. Input your physiological parameters and obtain predictions for blood sugar levels.
